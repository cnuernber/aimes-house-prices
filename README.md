# ames-house-prices

Exploration of kaggle ames house prices comp.

## Usage (Out of Date - get changelist 82aa05fc) 

From top level directory:
```
scripts/get-data.sh
```

The data is under data/ames-house-prices


Make sure you have openblas or atlas installed as well as libsvm.

If SVM doesn't work just remove it from the gridsearch pathways.  It is an old C
library that can be temperamental.  From ubuntu it works fine on jvm 8.


There is some dependency conflict with the csv subsystem tablesaw so from here is the workflow:

```clojure
lein repl

;;load the ames namespace
(require '[clj-ml-wkg/ames-house-prices])

(in-ns 'clj-ml-wkg/ames-house-prices)

;;Get past some dependency conflict

(def ds (load-dataset))

;;Either load initial results
(def gs-results (io/get-nippy "file://ames-initial-results.nippy"))

;;Or train
(def gs-result (gridsearch-the-things))


;;I haven't put any real effort into nice viz.  HALP!

There is no real dataset engineering past what I had to do to get things to load.  It is interesting
that xgboost and svm beat everthing initially.  In my experience, this indicates that you need
to do feature engineering as for this type of problem the linear methods should dominate :-).


Note that I named us the `Clojure ML Working Group`.  This fits in my experience at least with
C++ the only groups that did anything useful were the working groups.
